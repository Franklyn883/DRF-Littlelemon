## Introduction

Welcome to my Django API Course project! This repository showcases my learning journey in building a powerful API using Django, as part of my course in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apis?specialization=meta-back-end-developer). Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating RESTful endpoints, handling authentication, implementing CRUD operations, and much more.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Built using Django, this project provides a comprehensive RESTful API for various resources.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure endpoints using token-based authentication and restrict access based on user roles.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes Django ORM to interact with a SQlite database for seamless data management.
- **Validation and Serialization:** Implements robust input validation and output serialization using Django serializers.
- **Test Coverage:** Includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API.
